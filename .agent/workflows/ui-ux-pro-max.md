Comprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. Contains 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types with reasoning rules, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 technology stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use
- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Skip
- Pure backend logic, API/database design, performance unrelated to UI, infrastructure/DevOps, non-visual scripts

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, this Skill should be used.

| Priority | Category | Impact | Key Checks |
|----------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | Contrast 4.5:1, Alt text, Keyboard nav, Aria-labels |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | Min 44×44px, 8px+ spacing, Loading feedback |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | WebP/AVIF, Lazy loading, CLS < 0.1 |
| 4 | Style Selection | HIGH | Match product type, SVG icons (no emoji) |
| 5 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | Mobile-first, No horizontal scroll |
| 6 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | Base 16px, Line-height 1.5, Semantic tokens |
| 7 | Animation | MEDIUM | 150–300ms, transform/opacity only, reduce-motion |
| 8 | Forms & Feedback | MEDIUM | Visible labels, Error near field, Progressive disclosure |
| 9 | Navigation Patterns | HIGH | Predictable back, Bottom nav ≤5, Deep linking |
| 10 | Charts & Data | LOW | Legends, Tooltips, Accessible colors |

### Pre-Delivery Checklist
- [ ] No emojis as icons (use SVG: Heroicons/Lucide)
- [ ] cursor-pointer on all clickable elements
- [ ] Hover states with smooth transitions (150-300ms)
- [ ] Light mode: text contrast 4.5:1 minimum
- [ ] Focus states visible for keyboard nav
- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion respected
- [ ] Responsive: 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- [ ] Touch targets ≥44×44pt, safe areas respected
- [ ] Primary text contrast ≥4.5:1 in both light and dark mode
- [ ] No hardcoded hex colors — use semantic tokens
